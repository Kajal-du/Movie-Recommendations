# Movie-Recommendations
In this project we will recommend movies to the users by using Collaborative Filtering:
Fistly we imported and cleaned the data then we used scikit-surprise library to build a recommender system and did some Exploratory Data Analysis on the MovieLens Data
Removed the unwanted ratings from the dataset and thus do Dimensionality Reduction after that we Build a model by using Singular Value Decomposition algorithm and Created trainset and antiset from the data then we Trained the model and checked its performance by using RMSE(Root Mean Square Method) and MAE(Mean Absolute Errors) and Finally made predictions and recommend the top 5 movies movies for each user.
