# Movie-Recommendations
In this project we will recommend movies to the users by using Collaborative Filtering:
Fistly we will import and clean the data then we use scikit-surprise library to build a recommender system and do some Exploratory Data Analysis on the MovieLens Data and will remove the unwanted ratings from the dataset and thus do Dimensionality Reduction after that we Build a model by using Singular Value Decomposition Algorithm and will Create trainset and antiset from the data then we will Train the model and check its performance by using RMSE(Root Mean Square Method) and MAE(Mean Absolute Errors) and Finally we wiill make predictions and will recommend the top 5 movies movies for each user.
