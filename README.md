# Movie-Recommendations
In this project we will recommend movies to the users by using Collaborative Filtering:
Fistly we imported and cleaned the data
We used scikit-surprise library to build a recommender system
Did some Exploratory Data Analysis on the MovieLens Data
Removed the unwanted ratings from the dataset and thus do Dimensionality Reduction
Build a model by using Singular Value Decomposition algorithm 
Create trainset and antiset from the data
Train the and checked its performance by using RMSE(Root Mean Square Method) and MAE(Mean Absolute Errors)
Finally made predictions and recommend the top 5 movies movies for each user.
